Feature: Attrib(utes)
  In order to use track node information
  The system operator, Oscar
  wants inspect information discovered about the nodes
  and maybe add some of his own

  Scenario: UI Attrib List
    When I go to the "attribs" page
    Then I should see {bdd:rebar.i18n.attribs.index.title}
      And I should see "test-random"
      And there should be no translation errors

  Scenario: UI Attrib List Click to Attrib
    Given I am on the "attribs" page
    When I click on the "test-random" link
    Then I should see "test-random"
      And there should be no translation errors

  Scenario: REST Attrib List
    When REST gets the {object:attrib} list
    Then the list should have an object with key "name" value "test-random"
    Then the list should have an object with key "map" value "test/random"

  Scenario: REST JSON check
    When REST gets the {object:attrib} "test-random"
    Then the {object:attrib} is properly formatted

  Scenario: REST Can Delete
    Given REST creates the {object:attrib} "bdd_foo" with barclamp "test"
    When REST deletes the {object:attrib} "bdd_foo"
    Then I get a {integer:200} result
      And there is not a {object:attrib} "bdd_foo"

  Scenario: REST Get 404
    When REST gets the {object:attrib} "thisdoesnotexist"
    Then I get a {integer:404} error

  Scenario: REST creates with map value
    Given REST creates the {object:attrib} "bdd_data_map" with map "bdd/value"
    When REST gets the {object:attrib} "bdd_data_map"
    Then key "map" should be "bdd/value"
    Finally REST removes the {object:attrib} "bdd_data_map"

  Scenario: Test attrib value is detectable on node using map
    Given REST creates the {object:node} "bdd-test-attribs.cr0wbar.com"
      And REST creates the {object:attrib} "bdd_data_there" with map "bdd/easyway"
    When REST sets the node "bdd_data_there" on "bdd-test-attribs.cr0wbar.com" to "456"
    Then key "value" should be "456"
    Finally REST removes the {object:attrib} "bdd_data_there"
      And REST removes the {object:node} "bdd-test-attribs.cr0wbar.com"

  Scenario: attrib_ method missing works in UI pass without data
    Given REST creates the {object:node} "bdd-attrib-missing.cr0wbar.com"
    When I go to the "nodes/bdd-attrib-missing.cr0wbar.com" page
    Then I should see {bdd:rebar.i18n.nodes.show.bdd_marker} in section "column_50 last"
      And I should not see "foofoofoo" in section "column_50 last"
      And I should see {bdd:rebar.i18n.ignore} in section "column_50 last"
    Finally REST removes the {object:node} "bdd-attrib-missing.cr0wbar.com"

  Scenario: attrib_ method missing works in UI
    Given REST creates the {object:node} "bdd-attrib-methodmissing.cr0wbar.com"
      And REST creates the {object:attrib} "bdd_marker" with map "bdd/marker"
      And REST sets the node "bdd_marker" on "bdd-attrib-methodmissing.cr0wbar.com" to "foofoofoo"
    When I go to the "nodes/bdd-attrib-methodmissing.cr0wbar.com" page
    Then I should see "foofoofoo" in section "column_50 last"
    Finally REST removes the {object:attrib} "bdd_marker"
      And REST removes the {object:node} "bdd-attrib-methodmissing.cr0wbar.com"

  Scenario: Node loads test data
    Given there is a {object:node} "bdd-attrib1.data.edu"
      Given test loads the "node_discovery" data into {object:node} "bdd-attrib1.data.edu"
    When I go to the "nodes/bdd-attrib1.data.edu/attribs/os" page
    Then I should see "rebar"
      And I should see a link to "bdd-attrib1.data.edu"
      And I should see "os"
      And I should see "ohai/platform"
    Finally REST removes the {object:node} "bdd-attrib1.data.edu"

  Scenario: Node checks calculated attrib
    Given there is a {object:node} "bdd-attrib2.data.edu"
      Given test loads the "node_discovery" data into {object:node} "bdd-attrib2.data.edu"
    When I go to the "nodes/bdd-attrib2.data.edu/attribs/number_of_drives" page
    Then I should see "1"
      And I should see a link to "bdd-attrib2.data.edu"
      And I should see "number_of_drives"
    Finally REST removes the {object:node} "bdd-attrib2.data.edu"
